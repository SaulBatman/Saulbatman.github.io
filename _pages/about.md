# About 

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Mingxi Jia. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by Professor Stefanie Tellex. I‚Äôm interested in building general-purpose learning-based robot manipulation algorithms. Before Brown, I got my master's degree in Robotics (Computer Science concentration) from Northeastern University, Boston, where I was fortunate to work with Professor Robert Platt. I received my Bachelor's degree (in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing, and its Automation) at Beijing University of Chemical Technology (BUCT). Please feel free to send me an email via mingxi_jia@brown.edu if you have any questions!
